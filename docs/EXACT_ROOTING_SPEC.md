# Exact-rooting audit — spec for issue #140

Status: SPEC (2026-06-10). The next major work item, ahead of all further
perf packets. Companion evidence lives in issue #140; the dead-key fix that
opened this line of work landed as `9c5125c` (canary
`canary_p_deadkey_tombstone`).

## 0. Why this outranks everything else

ASAN found a FAMILY of latent use-after-frees: objects the VM still uses
get swept because the GC's root set does not exactly cover them. These are
cadence-dependent — any allocation-size or pacing change re-rolls whether a
given program silently reads recycled memory or segfaults. Three instances
are known; the class is systemic. Until the root set is provably exact,
every perf packet is a dice roll on top of memory corruption, and a release
would ship a known deterministic segfault (`target/release/lua-rs
harness/impl/official/db.wrap.lua` crashes every run).

**Goal.** Make the statement "every object reachable by future VM execution
is reachable from the root trace at every collection point" mechanically
checked, not vibes. Fix the two open bugs as corollaries.

**Definition of done.**
- The stress+ASAN battery (P0) runs the FULL official suite plus the GC
  canaries with zero sanitizer reports, in both GC modes.
- The official suite passes with the RELEASE-profile binary (the gap that
  hid bug A), and that run is part of the PR gate.
- Issue #140's two bugs have dedicated canaries that fail on their parent
  commits.
- No perf regression outside the tolerance policy on the standard A/B
  matrix (exactness changes touch call/return hot paths — gate them like
  any packet).

**Non-goals.** No GC algorithm redesign; no switch away from index-based
stacks; no `unsafe` additions.

## 1. Evidence inventory (what we know going in)

| # | Bug | State | Repro | ASAN signature |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Dead-key tombstones: nil'd table entries left dereferenceable freed keys | FIXED `9c5125c` | `canary_p_deadkey_tombstone` (11 lines, deterministic) | READ 1 in `TableNode::key_is_short_str`, freed by sweep, alloc'd by lexer `intern_str` |
| 2 | Coroutine traceback reads swept `LuaLClosure` (#140 bug A) | FIXED `0677646` | was: release db.wrap exit 139 every run; now `canary_q_coro_traceback_root` under stress+quarantine | Mechanism: debug-API thread borrows (`traceback`/`getinfo`/`getlocal`/`setlocal`) held the target's RefCell across allocations; `trace_reachable_threads` silently skipped the borrowed thread (the §1 try_borrow suspect, confirmed by the P0.b assert). Fix: `RootedThreadBorrow` snapshot guard |
| 3 | Root tracer derefs stale slots fed from the FRAME-RANGE walk (#140 bug B) | FIXED (P2 option (d)) | battery config 2 (stress+quarantine db/coroutine/db.wrap): deterministic panic at parent (`9807995` battery run 20260610T203110Z), clean after (run 20260610T2057+) | Mechanism: we ported C's Protect top-raises without C's atomic dead-slice clear, so the marker walked garbage. Fix: trace `[0..top)`, clear dead slice before every collect, site-local savestate fixups. Heuristic + range walk deleted |
| 4 | Weak prune skipped erased entries — dead key never tombstoned (`equal_key` derefs swept long-string key) | FIXED `1a04425` | `canary_r_weak_erased_deadkey`; was: gc.lua under quarantine | Found by the battery's first run. C parity: `clearbykeys`/`clearbyvalues` unconditionally `clearkey` empty entries; our `prune_weak_dead_with_value` skipped value-nil nodes |

Named suspects from the code audit (2026-06-10, this spec's revision):

- **`try_borrow` silent root loss.** `trace_reachable_threads`
  (`crates/lua-vm/src/state.rs` ~4228) skips any thread whose `RefCell`
  cannot be borrowed at collect time — silently. The snapshot pools cover
  exactly one such path (the resume chain). Any other borrow held across
  an allocation — `debug.traceback(co)` introspecting a coroutine while
  interning frame-name strings is the prime candidate — un-roots the
  entire coroutine for that cycle. Bug-A-shaped. Immediate mitigation
  regardless of diagnosis: debug-assert that every borrow-failure is
  covered by a snapshot (see P0).
- **Finished-coroutine top/ci asymmetry.** The tracer covers
  `[ci.func .. top)` for the current frame; if coroutine completion
  resets `top` low while leaving the ci chain walkable,
  `debug.traceback` still reads `get_at(ci.func)`
  (`debug.rs::ci_lua_proto`) on slots the tracer never covered. Also a
  divergence question: C's dead coroutine has `ci == base_ci` (no
  walkable frames).
- **Exactness has two sides.** The root-gap classes above are all of the
  form *some reader's read-set ⊄ the tracer's trace-set*. The debug
  machinery reads beyond `top` (ci.func slots, `getlocal` up to
  `ci.top`); the tracer stops at `top`. P1 must inventory readers, not
  just storage locations.

Hard-won method facts:
- ASAN build: `RUSTFLAGS=-Zsanitizer=address cargo +nightly build -p
  lua-cli --target aarch64-apple-darwin`. lldb cannot attach in the agent
  environment; macOS crash reports are unreadable; gmalloc did not trip.
  ASAN-first is the rule for this class.
- `LUA_RS_GC_STRESS=1` (HARDMEMTESTS equivalent, landed `9c5125c`) makes
  `would_collect`/`step` fire at every checkpoint. It surfaced bug 3 in
  seconds. It does NOT reproduce bug 2 (stress changes the cadence that
  bug needs) — stress finds anchoring bugs at allocation points, but
  bugs that need a collect in a NARROW window between two distant VM
  events can hide from it. Both instruments are needed.
- GC-cadence bugs are NOT line-bisectable: early-exit injection perturbs
  allocation history and masks them (measured: injection at line 824 made
  the full-file crash vanish).
- db.lua tests pattern-match their own filename — standalone section
  repros must live at a path ending in `db.lua`.

## 2. The problem statement (why the class exists)

C-Lua's rooting model is implicit but total: every live value is reachable
from `L->stack[0 .. L->top]` (plus ci chain tops during calls), the
registry, globals via the registry, open upvalues, and the fixed objects —
and C maintains the discipline that **`luaC_checkGC` is only called at
points where everything live is anchored in one of those places**
(`lvm.c` checks it between instructions with `L->top` set; allocation
helpers anchor intermediates on the stack first).

Our port has four structural deviations, each a root-gap class:

1. **Frame-bounded trace ranges.** `LuaState::trace` walks the ci chain
   and traces `[ci.func .. next_ci.func)` per frame, `[ci.func ..
   self.top)` for the current frame — deliberately NOT `[.. ci.top]`
   because the reserved tail "can contain stale values from previous
   calls". The compensation is (2).
2. **The debug-local heuristic.** Named locals above `top` are traced via
   `get_local_name(proto, n, saved_pc)` metadata. `saved_pc` is only
   current at call boundaries — mid-frame it is stale, so the heuristic
   can BOTH under-cover (miss a live local → bug-A-like) and over-read
   (trace a slot whose value is garbage → bug 3).
3. **Rust-frame temporaries.** VM opcode arms, stdlib C-functions, and
   debug machinery hold `GcRef`s in Rust locals across allocation points.
   The GC cannot see Rust frames. C avoids the equivalent by anchoring on
   the Lua stack before any allocation; our code sometimes does not
   (bug 2's victim is reachable only via a coroutine frame the walk
   apparently does not cover, or via a Rust local during traceback).
4. **Suspended/finished coroutines.** A coroutine's frames are traced
   through its `LuaThread` object via the same range logic, with
   `cached_thread_id`-gated extras. Yield/resume/death transitions move
   `top` and the ci chain in ways the range logic must exactly track —
   and the coroutine snapshot pools (`04cd144`) added a parallel rooting
   structure that must agree with it.

## 3. Phases

### P0 — instruments first (the battery)

**P0.a — the rung-2 instrument: quarantine/poison mode.** The ASAN
battery below is a rung-6 tool (nightly build, slow, signature
archaeology, lldb cannot attach). Per the fast-iteration-tools doctrine,
build the in-process deterministic tester FIRST: `LUA_RS_GC_QUARANTINE=1`
— sweep does not free; it unlinks the GcBox, poisons the header
(dedicated `Color::Freed`-style state), and parks the box on a quarantine
list. `Marker::mark_box` and the debug deref path assert against poisoned
headers / removed allocation tokens. Combined with `LUA_RS_GC_STRESS=1`,
any read of a swept object becomes a deterministic Rust panic with a
backtrace in a plain debug build, in milliseconds, no nightly. The heap
already maintains `allocation_tokens` (sweep removes the token), so the
validation half may largely exist — surface it as a first-class
instrument. Memory grows unboundedly under quarantine; test-only by
design. ASAN remains the truth-teller for reads that bypass headers.

**P0.b — the try_borrow assert.** In `trace_reachable_threads`,
debug-assert that the number of marked-alive threads whose state cannot
be borrowed at collect time is covered by the parent-snapshot structure
(audit the actual borrow lifecycle for the exact invariant). This
converts the silent under-coverage into a loud failure independent of
whether it is bug A's mechanism.

**P0.c — the battery.** Build `harness/asan-stress.sh`:
- Caches the nightly ASAN build keyed on commit sha (bincache pattern).
- Runs, under BOTH `LUA_RS_GC_STRESS=1` and stress-off, in BOTH GC modes:
  all GC canaries, the deadkey/#140 repro set, and the full official
  suite (stress full-suite will be slow — provide `--quick` running the
  canaries + db/gc/coroutine/locals/api subset; full sweep is the
  end-of-phase gate).
- Greps ASAN reports; any report = FAIL with the report saved as
  evidence. Exit codes wired for CI use.
- Add a RELEASE-profile `run_official_all.sh` invocation (`LUA_RS_BIN`
  override exists) to the PR gate — this alone would have caught bug 2
  years... weeks earlier.

**Red-gate trap.** The release-profile gate will be red from day one
(db.wrap segfaults every run until P3). A permanently red gate trains
everyone to ignore it. Gate on "no NEW failures vs a baseline TSV"
(adjacency-gate pattern) or quarantine db.wrap with written
justification; un-quarantine as part of P3's proof.

Acceptance: battery runs; documents current state (expected: bug-2 trip
on db, bug-3 trip under stress, ideally both now ALSO tripping as Rust
panics under stress+quarantine); wired into `harness/CLAUDE.md` + bench
README.

### P1 — root-source inventory (pre-computed analysis, not archaeology)

Two reframings from the code audit:

1. **Checkpoints, not allocations.** Allocation entry points do not
   collect inline — collection fires only at the explicit
   `gc_cond_step`/`gc_check_step` checkpoints (~25 sites in vm.rs,
   do_.rs, api.rs, tagmethods.rs). Holding a `GcRef` in a Rust local
   across allocations *within one opcode arm* is safe today; the real
   contract is "no checkpoint between allocation and rooting". So the
   Rust-temporary audit enumerates what is live-but-unrooted AT each
   checkpoint — a far smaller surface than grepping every allocation.
2. **Readers, not just storage.** For every reader of stack/ci data
   (VM, debug machinery, stdlib introspection), is its read-set ⊆ the
   trace-set at every checkpoint? Bug A is exactly a reader
   (`debug.traceback`) whose read-set the tracer does not cover.

Produce `ANALYSES/GC_ROOTS.md`: every place a `GcRef`/`Gc` can live,
audited against "who traces this, and is it traced at every
`would_collect` checkpoint?":

stack slots (per-frame ranges + top discipline), ci chain func slots,
globals/registry, open + closed upvalues, hook registry
(`registry[HOOKKEY]`, weak-keyed) AND the VM-level hook closure box,
coroutine LuaStates + snapshot pools + yielded values, to-be-closed list,
metatables (incl. `setmetatable(t,t)` self-cycles), string table (weak by
design — dead-interned removal contract), pending finalizer lists,
lua-rs-runtime embedding handles, and — the open-ended class — Rust-frame
temporaries in lua-vm/lua-stdlib (per reframing 1: enumerate per
checkpoint, not per allocation; each checkpoint needs a "what is
live-but-unrooted here?" answer).

Additional rows the audit already knows it owes:

- `strcache` is traced as a STRONG root (`trace_impls.rs` ~196) where C
  clears stale cache entries in the atomic pass — over-retention
  divergence; weak/resurrection canaries get a row.
- `try_borrow` coverage in `trace_reachable_threads` (P0.b's assert is
  the mitigation; the row documents the invariant).
- Stack shrink sites: C shrinks thread stacks only inside the atomic
  pass (`luaD_shrinkstack` in `traversethread`); any port site that
  shrinks elsewhere vs ci entries above the new length.
- Snapshot push/pop balance in `coro_lib.rs` (multiple pop sites; error
  and unwind paths must not leak or double-pop) and snapshot coverage
  (full live stack incl. ci.func slots?).
- Defensive code that can mask coverage bugs, to convert to asserts: the
  dead else-branch in the frame walk (non-current frame with
  `ci.next == None` traces to `self.top`) and the
  `end_idx.min(self.stack.len())` clamp in `LuaState::trace`.

Each row gets: traced-by, checkpoint coverage, and a canary exercising it
under stress+ASAN (the fast in-memory tester doctrine — most can be
5-line Lua snippets in the canary battery).

### P2 — strategy decision (measure, then choose)

The core design choice for the stack, decided by spike + recount, not
taste:

- **(a) C-style top discipline.** Make `state.top` always cover live
  slots and audit every allocation checkpoint for anchoring. Faithful,
  zero over-marking, but it is a forever-discipline on every future
  contributor — and the current range logic exists precisely because our
  top is NOT maintained that way.
- **(b) Range widening + pop hygiene.** Trace `[ci.func .. ci.top]` for
  every frame, and CLEAR slots on frame pop / top decrease so stale slots
  are nil (kills bug 3's input AND removes the need for the debug-local
  heuristic entirely — delete it). Cost: clearing on the call-return hot
  path. MEASURE with the Ir rig (`call_only` probe + call_return_shapes)
  before committing; budget tolerance per the standard gate. Note C
  effectively pays this cost differently (its top discipline keeps the
  window small).
- **(c) Anchor API for Rust temporaries.** Whatever (a)/(b)/(d) decides,
  the Rust-frame class needs either a scoped anchor (`state.anchor(value)`
  RAII pushing to a traced side-stack) or a rule that C-function code
  keeps values on the Lua stack across allocations. Inventory P1 decides
  how many sites exist; if few, fix in place; if many, build the API.
  Audit data so far: ~30 hold-across-allocation sites, ~5 near
  checkpoints (worst: VarArgPack, `vm.rs` ~3518-3530). Presumption: fix
  in place, no API; enforce dynamically via quarantine+stress canaries.
- **(d) C's actual composite design — the presumptive winner, spike it
  first.** (a) and (b) split what C does into halves and price each
  half in the expensive place. C does both halves, each where it is
  cheap:
  - *Exactness only at checkpoints.* `lvm.c:1131`:
    `#define checkGC(L,c) { luaC_condGC(L, (savepc(L), L->top.p = (c)), ...)}`
    — top is MADE exact by one store at each checkpoint
    (`checkGC(L, ra + 1)` after OP_NEWTABLE/OP_CLOSURE,
    `checkGC(L, L->top.p)` after concat). Collections only happen at
    checkpoints, so top only needs to be true there. ~25 sites, each
    with a live mark the C source hands us.
  - *Stale-slot clearing once per GC cycle, inside the GC.*
    `lgc.c traversethread`, atomic phase:
    `for (o = th->top.p; o < th->stack_last.p + EXTRA_STACK; o++) setnilvalue(s2v(o));`
    — the dead tail is nil'd during the atomic pass. The return hot
    path clears nothing.

  Under (d) the frame-bounded range walk collapses to C's `[0 .. top)`,
  the debug-local heuristic is DELETED (bug B dies as a class), and the
  suspended/finished-coroutine asymmetry behind bug A loses its
  structural cause. §4's "widening without clearing" trap is answered
  the way C answers it — lazily, in-GC. Implementation wrinkle:
  `Trace::trace` takes `&self`; the clear pass needs `Cell` slots or a
  separate `&mut` pre-mark phase mirroring C's atomic. Readers must
  then tolerate nil where they previously read stale-but-alive values
  (`ci_lua_proto` currently panics on a non-closure slot).

Spike deliverables: Ir delta for (d)'s checkpoint stores + once-per-cycle
clear vs (b)'s clear-on-pop; A/B on call-heavy rows; written decision in
this spec.

**DECISION (2026-06-10): option (d), as-implemented shape.** Trace is
exactly C's `[0 .. top)` (`gc_trace_bound`), the dead slice
`[top .. stack.len())` is nil'd before every collect
(`clear_dead_stack_tail` for self at the checkpoint wrappers +
`gc_pre_collect_clear` at the 15 direct `check_step` sites + all
borrowable registered threads), and checkpoints whose C original runs
under `Protect` get the site-local `savestate` top fixup
(`get_varargs` both branches, VarArgPack arm). The debug-local heuristic
and the frame-bounded range walk are DELETED.

Two variants were tried and rejected with data:
- *Bound widening to `max(top, current ci.top)` globally*: over-retains
  every suspended frame's reserved slice forever; the generational pacer
  thrashes (db.lua's line-hook section went from seconds to 120s+
  timeout, profile 100% inside `minor_collect`).
- *Widening only for Lua current frames*: still over-retains
  (`v51_gc_on_userdata_registered_by_setmetatable_fires` showed stale
  argument copies surviving an explicit `collectgarbage()` — finalizers
  did not fire).

Perf (interleaved A/B vs `9807995`, 8 pairs, M3 Max, 2026-06-10):
binarytrees 0.987 improved, fibonacci 0.971 improved, gc_pressure 0.982
improved (RSS 0.887), call_return_shapes/closure_ops/coroutine_pingpong/
method_calls inconclusive (medians 0.99–1.02). Zero regressed; no
tracked line items needed.

### P3 — fix bug A (coroutine traceback)

With P0's battery + P1's coroutine rows: reproduce bug 2 in a dedicated
canary (suspend/finish coroutines, force minor collects via stress,
traceback at every state), fix per the P2 strategy, prove with ASAN +
canary + release-profile db.wrap green ×10 runs.

### P4 — fix bug B (debug-local tracing)

Falls out of P2(b) or P2(d) if either is chosen (delete the heuristic).
If (a)
is chosen instead: make the heuristic read-safe (only trace slots below a
verified live-water mark) or replace with precise liveness from the
function's `maxstacksize`/active-range metadata at a SAVED pc that is
guaranteed current (save pc before any checkpoint that can collect —
audit). Same proof obligations.

### P5 — drive the battery clean

Full official suite + canaries under stress+ASAN, both GC modes, zero
reports. This is the real DoD. Time-box the full-suite stress runs
(stress is slow); quarantine-with-justification anything that cannot run
stressed, mirroring the bench manifest pattern.

### P6 — unwind the queue

- Re-gate and land the stashed R2 (LuaTable field diet — stash
  `R2-luatable-field-diet`, table box 144 → 128 B).
- Re-run the perf wrap matrices (stock + PGO) — exactness changes will
  have moved numbers; the PGO retraining follow-up from the model doc
  rides along.
- THEN release (see §5).

## 4. Risks and traps

- **Over-marking is not free-safe.** Widened ranges trace stale slots —
  garbage refs in the marker is bug 3 by another road. Widening WITHOUT
  pop-clearing is strictly worse than today. The pair is atomic. (Option
  (d) pairs them C's way: clear lazily in-GC, not on pop.)
- **`try_borrow` is a silent root-loss primitive.** Any thread borrow
  held across an allocation point un-roots that thread for the cycle,
  and nothing reports it. P0.b's assert is mandatory before trusting
  any battery-green result.
- **Resurrection semantics.** Over-marking can keep weak-table entries /
  finalizable objects alive a cycle longer than C. The weak/ephemeron
  canaries and gc.lua/gengc.lua are the oracle; any divergence is a
  failed gate, not a judgment call.
- **Perf.** Pop-clearing and anchor traffic sit on call/return paths the
  W2.2 diet was about to attack. Every exactness change goes through the
  standard packet gate (recount + interleaved A/B + tolerance policy).
  The two workstreams meet in P6.
- **Stress-mode re-entrancy.** `would_collect` always-true must never
  trigger collection FROM collection paths (current stress implementation
  rides existing checkpoints only — keep it that way; assert in debug).
- **The instruments lie last.** Bug 2 hides from stress; bug 3 hides
  without it. P5 requires BOTH configurations, both GC modes, both build
  profiles.

## 5. Release policy

No release until P5. The current deterministic release-profile segfault
(bug A) means a release today ships a known crash — worse, the release CI
itself runs release-profile binaries through `make perf-pgo`'s
conformance gate and may go red on db.lua nondeterministically. After P5,
the standard `RELEASING.md` flow applies, and the release notes get the
correctness-fix headline (dead keys + rooting audit), which is also the
honest changelog story for why this release matters more than its perf
numbers.

## 6. Acceptance checklist

- [x] P0 quarantine/poison mode exists; stress+quarantine reproduces the
      open bugs as deterministic Rust panics (`4d9a4f0`)
- [x] P0 try_borrow coverage assert lands (debug builds) (`d3ca272`)
- [x] P0 battery exists (`harness/asan-stress.sh`), wired (`make
      rooting-battery`, CI `--quarantine-only` gate), documented
      (`harness/CLAUDE.md`, `crates/lua-gc/CLAUDE.md`); release-profile
      suite in PR gate (`make test` → `conformance-release`, 44/44 green)
- [x] `ANALYSES/GC_ROOTS.md` complete (per-row canary column; rows 1/2
      now fixed per P2 decision)
- [x] P2 strategy decision recorded with spike numbers (§3 P2 DECISION)
- [x] Bug A fixed: canary_q (fails on parent, passes at fix) + release
      db.wrap green ×10 (`0677646`); ASAN-confirmed clean (battery
      `--asan` at `abe2b52`, stress on/off)
- [x] Bug B fixed: battery config 2 (stress+quarantine db/coroutine/
      db.wrap) is the dedicated regression oracle — deterministic panic
      at parent `9807995`, clean after; ASAN-confirmed clean at
      `abe2b52` (stress on/off)
- [x] Battery clean at `abe2b52` (2026-06-10): all canaries both GC
      modes under quarantine AND stress+quarantine; FULL official suite
      under quarantine; repro set under ASAN stress on/off; official
      suite 44/44 on BOTH build profiles. Remaining time-boxed extension:
      full-suite stress sweep (spec P5 allows quarantine-with-
      justification; the 4 cadence-assert canaries f/l/m/n are the
      documented stress exclusions)
- [x] Perf gates green: interleaved A/B vs `9807995` zero regressed
      (3 improved, 4 inconclusive; no tracked line items)
- [ ] R2 landed; fresh matrices; release shipped per RELEASING.md
