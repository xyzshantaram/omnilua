# Public README Handoff

This is a content handoff for rewriting the root README into a public-facing
project page. The current README still reads like an agent-porting work log.
The public README should lead with the runtime and move the harness material
lower.

## Public Positioning

Lead with:

> `lua-rs` is a Lua 5.4.7 runtime implemented in Rust.

The project currently has two stories:

1. the runtime: `lua-rs`, published as the `lua-cli` crate with a `lua-rs`
   binary;
2. the porting harness: official-test runners, benchmark history, unsafe-budget
   checks, and debugging notes used to build the port.

The runtime story should come first. The harness story is valuable, but it is
secondary for new users evaluating a Rust Lua runtime.

## Current Facts To State

- Crates.io preview release exists at `0.0.1`.
- Install command:

  ```bash
  cargo install lua-cli
  ```

- Installed binary:

  ```bash
  lua-rs -e 'print("hello from lua-rs")'
  lua-rs script.lua
  ```

- The package name is `lua-cli`; the binary name is `lua-rs`.
- The upstream Lua 5.4.7 official suite passes 44/44 in the repo harness.
- Normal script execution has no C runtime dependency.
- Most crates forbid `unsafe`.
- Remaining unsafe is budgeted in `lua-gc`, the `lua-cli` dynamic-loading
  backend, and the dedicated `lua-wasm` / `lua-wasm-smoke` pointer ABI crates.
- The project is not LuaJIT.

## Do Not Overclaim

Do not claim:

- a REPL exists;
- stdin execution works;
- complete PUC-Rio Lua C API compatibility;
- ABI drop-in compatibility with `liblua`;
- arbitrary existing Lua C modules load unchanged;
- completely safe Rust;
- LuaJIT-level performance.

Current CLI gaps:

- `lua-rs -e '...'` works.
- `lua-rs script.lua` works.
- a bare non-file argument is treated as source and works.
- `echo 'print("hi")' | lua-rs -` does not work today.
- `lua-rs --help` is not a polished help path today.
- There is no REPL today.

Good phrasing:

> The preview release targets Lua source/runtime compatibility first. Rust-native
> embedding and C API compatibility are future goals.

See `docs/FUTURE_GOALS.md` for the API/ABI distinction.

## Suggested README Shape

1. `# lua-rs`
2. One-paragraph description.
3. Status bullets.
4. Install.
5. Usage examples.
6. Compatibility / conformance.
7. Performance.
8. Safety model.
9. Limitations and non-goals.
10. Crate layout.
11. Development / verification commands.
12. Porting harness docs.

## Conformance Section

Suggested wording:

> The repository's Lua 5.4.7 official-test harness currently passes 44/44 tests.
> This is strong evidence for Lua source/runtime compatibility. It does not imply
> C API or ABI compatibility.

Useful command:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS='-Awarnings' cargo build -q --bin lua-rs
RUSTFLAGS='-Awarnings' TEST_TIMEOUT_S=90 ./harness/run_official_all.sh
```

## Performance Section

The dashboard is the strongest public performance artifact:

- local file: `harness/bench/history/index.html`
- source data: `harness/evidence/ledger.jsonl`
- builder: `python3 harness/bench/history.py`

Latest tracked dashboard artifact reports:

- 1046 measurements over 36 commits;
- wall-time geomean about `1.27x` versus upstream PUC-Rio Lua 5.4.7 across the
  benchmark set;
- RSS geomean about `1.96x`;
- workload-level variance, including some workloads below `1.0x` and others
  above it.

Lower ratio is better. `1.00x` is parity with upstream Lua on the same workload.

Do not summarize this as simply "faster than C." Link the dashboard and let the
workload-level data carry the nuance.

Current public-link caveat:

- local `main` was ahead of `origin/main` when this note was written, so any
  RawGithack/GitHub Pages link based on `main` may show stale dashboard data
  until commits are pushed.

## Safety Section

Suggested wording:

> `lua-rs` exposes a safe public surface over a small audited unsafe core. Most
> crates forbid unsafe code. The remaining unsafe surface is budgeted in
> `lua-gc`, the `lua-cli` dynamic-library backend, and the dedicated WASM ABI
> crates.

Do not call the project "completely safe Rust."

## LuaRocks Meaning

Plain-English framing:

> LuaRocks is the standard Lua package manager. Running it under `lua-rs` means
> the runtime can do more than pass language conformance tests: it can run a real
> Lua ecosystem tool, install a real pure-Lua package, rebuild the installed
> package manifest, and load that package through `require`.

Why it matters:

- It proves a real ecosystem workflow, not just isolated semantics.
- It exercises filesystem, subprocess, package loading, script arguments,
  `os.exit`, and LuaFileSystem behavior together.
- It gives a clear honest boundary: pure-Lua rocks can work; stock native C
  rocks still need Rust-native replacements or a Lua C API/ABI layer.

Good README-sized wording:

> LuaRocks self-hosting is in progress. `lua-rs` can run LuaRocks 3.11.1 well
> enough to search, install, list, show, and use pure-Lua rocks such as
> `inspect`. Native C rocks remain out of scope until the project has either
> targeted Rust-native module replacements or a PUC-Rio Lua C API/ABI
> compatibility layer.

Detailed explainer:

- `docs/LUAROCKS_SIGNIFICANCE.md`

## LuaRocks Status

LuaRocks is now a credible in-progress feature, but still not a broad ecosystem
compatibility headline.

Current verified state:

- LuaRocks 3.11.1 boots under `lua-rs`.
- Basic commands work: `--version`, `help`, `config lua_version`, `path`,
  `list`, `show`, and `which`.
- Local `luarocks make` works for a toy pure-Lua rock.
- Remote `luarocks search inspect` works.
- Remote `luarocks install inspect` works.
- The installed `inspect` module can be loaded and run under `lua-rs`.
- The stock LuaRocks script can be run directly; `lua-cli` masks a leading
  Unix shebang line before parsing script files.
- Native C rocks are not supported today. A `luafilesystem` install probe
  reaches the native build step and fails on missing `lua.h`, which is expected
  without a PUC-Rio Lua C API/ABI layer.

Good roadmap phrasing:

> LuaRocks self-hosting is in progress: LuaRocks 3.11.1 can install and use
> pure-Lua rocks under `lua-rs`; native C rocks remain out of scope until either
> targeted Rust-native modules or a C API/ABI compatibility layer exist.

Remaining LuaRocks work:

- clean up the `=[C]` program/chunk name;
- add a checked-in LuaRocks smoke harness;
- broaden the curated pure-Lua package matrix;
- avoid arbitrary native rocks until a C API/ABI strategy exists.
