# Publish Readiness

Status date: 2026-05-24.

This project has an initial crates.io release at `0.0.1`. Treat future release
work as three separate lanes:

1. public repository / technical preview;
2. binary release of `lua-rs`;
3. crates.io release of the crate graph.

The crate graph lane is complete for the initial `0.0.1` preview. The binary
release lane still needs a separate release process.

## Current Claim

The honest public claim is:

- Lua 5.4.7-compatible runtime in Rust;
- official Lua test harness currently passes 44/44 in the port-compatible
  runner;
- no C runtime dependency for normal script execution;
- safe public surface over a small audited unsafe core;
- not a drop-in replacement for C-Lua's C ABI;
- not LuaJIT and not intended to match LuaJIT performance.

## Unsafe Positioning

Do not describe the project as "completely safe Rust."

Describe it as:

> The runtime keeps unsafe code behind explicit budgets. Most crates forbid
> unsafe code. The trusted unsafe surface is currently `lua-gc`, the `lua-cli`
> dynamic-library backend, and the dedicated WASM ABI crates.

Current budget summary:

- `lua-gc`: 13 counted sites, all in `heap.rs`;
- `lua-cli`: 5 counted sites for `libloading` / dynamic module loading;
- `lua-wasm`: 19 counted sites for the import/export pointer ABI;
- `lua-wasm-smoke`: 17 counted sites in the non-published smoke harness ABI;
- `lua-coro`: 0, with `unsafe_code = "forbid"` until a concrete stackful
  backend lands;
- all other runtime crates: expected 0.

The remaining `lua-gc` unsafe is the collector kernel: `Gc<T>` dereference,
intrusive allgc walking, gray-queue dereference, sweep cursor management, and
`Box::from_raw` reclamation. The key safety invariant is that collection only
runs at safepoints where live `Gc<T>` handles are reachable from the traced root
graph.

## Package Audit

Resolved for `0.0.1`:

- Root `LICENSE` is required because manifests declare `license = "MIT"`.
- Root README must stay current with the actual 44/44 status and the unsafe
  story.
- Accidental runtime artifacts do not belong in the repo root. Known examples
  removed during this pass: `appendonly.aof`, `dump.rdb`, `luac.out`.
- Internal workspace dependencies now specify both `path` and `version`, which
  is required for crates.io packaging.
- Manifests now have shared description, repository, and homepage metadata.
- `lua-cli-test-rust-module` is a test fixture and should not be published.

Crates.io release status:

- Published at `0.0.1`: `lua-gc`, `lua-types`, `lua-vm`, `lua-code`,
  `lua-lex`, `lua-stdlib`, `lua-coro`, `lua-rs-lfs`, `lua-parse`,
  and `lua-cli`.
- Not published: `lua-cli-test-rust-module`, intentionally marked
  `publish = false`.
- Dependency-order publishing matters because Cargo verifies packaged crates
  against registry dependencies, not unpublished local paths.

## Public Preview Checklist

Required before calling the repo public-preview ready:

- README states the current compatibility, safety, and non-goal story.
- `LICENSE` exists and matches manifest metadata.
- Root-level generated or accidental artifacts are removed or ignored.
- Official suite is green: `RUSTFLAGS='-Awarnings' TEST_TIMEOUT_S=90 ./harness/run_official_all.sh`.
- Workspace check is green: `RUSTFLAGS='-Awarnings' cargo check -q`.
- Unsafe budget hook is green: `.claude/hooks/unsafe-budget.sh`.
- Package readiness smoke is green: `./harness/check_publish_readiness.sh`.
- Performance dashboard has a recent datapoint and does not claim C parity
  without context.
- A known-gaps section links to deeper docs instead of hiding limitations.

## Binary Release Checklist

Required before releasing `lua-rs` binaries:

- Decide target triples and build mode.
- Add a smoke test for `lua-rs 'print("hello")'`.
- Track `Cargo.lock` or document why binary release builds are intentionally
  unlocked.
- Build release binary with `cargo build --release --bin lua-rs`.
- Run the official suite against the release binary using `LUA_RS_BIN`.
- Document unsupported C ABI behavior and dynamic-loading caveats.

## Crates.io Checklist

Completed for `0.0.1`:

- Package metadata exists: description, repository, homepage, license, and
  README inheritance where applicable.
- Internal dependencies specify version requirements while keeping local `path`
  entries for workspace development.
- Fixtures/internal-only crates are marked with `publish = false`.
- Published/verified in dependency order:
  `lua-gc`, `lua-types`, `lua-vm`, then leaves such as `lua-code`,
  `lua-lex`, `lua-stdlib`, `lua-coro`, `lua-rs-lfs`, `lua-parse`,
  and finally `lua-cli`.
- Each publishable crate passed `cargo publish --dry-run` before upload.

Before future non-preview releases:

- Reconfirm crate ownership and long-term naming.
- Decide which low-level crates are public API versus implementation detail.
- Review package contents with `cargo package --list`.
- Run the full release gate, not just package dry-runs.

## Recommended Next Order

1. Expand `harness/check_publish_readiness.sh` into a full release gate that
   also runs the official suite, unsafe budget, and a CLI smoke test.
2. Add a binary release path for `lua-rs`.
3. Decide whether the current crate names are permanent before a broader
   announcement.
4. Clean warning debt before raising the public API stability claim.
