# lua-rs: one way to build and test.
#
#   make test          build + Rust tests + conformance (what CI runs)
#   make rust          workspace unit/integration tests + embedding doctests
#   make conformance   official Lua 5.4 suite against the lua-rs binary
#   make conformance-release  same suite, RELEASE-profile binary (#140: release
#                      cadence hid a GC use-after-free the debug suite missed)
#   make rooting-battery      quarantine/stress GC rooting battery (#140 P0)
#   make conformance-55 official Lua 5.5 suite against the lua-rs binary
#   make lua55-reference build Lua 5.5 compat-on and compat-off C references
#   make oracle-55     behavioral diff snippets vs reference C Lua 5.5.0
#   make parity        behavioral diff vs reference C Lua 5.4.7 (the oracle)
#   make perf          benchmark vs reference C Lua (measurement, not a gate)
#   make scaling       flag superlinear (O(n^2)) behavior in hot operations
#   make profile F=... sample a hotpath profile of running script F (needs samply)
#   make build         debug lua-rs binary
#   make setup         bootstrap the conformance test directory
#
# `make test` is the gate. It builds its own binary (no stale-binary trap)
# and runs exactly what CI runs.
