# lua-rs

A Lua 5.4.7 interpreter written in Rust. It runs Lua programs as a standalone
binary with no C dependency, and passes the full upstream PUC-Rio test suite
(44/44).

```bash
cargo install lua-cli      # the crate is `lua-cli`; the binary it installs is `lua-rs`
lua-rs -e 'print("hello")'
```

## Highlights

- Passes the full upstream Lua 5.4.7 test suite (44/44).
- A standalone binary: no `liblua`, no C interpreter, no C toolchain to build it.
- Rust-native embedding API (`lua-rs-runtime`): owned handles, Rust callbacks,
  `UserData`, and `scope` for lending non-`'static` borrows like `&mut World`.
  Embeds in WebAssembly and anywhere a C binding can't.
- Mostly safe Rust, with unsafe isolated to audited GC, dynamic-loading, and
  WASM pointer-ABI boundaries.
- Competitive with reference C (~1.3× geomean wall time), benchmarked per commit.

## Usage

```bash
lua-rs                          # REPL
lua-rs script.lua               # run a file
lua-rs -e 'print(1 + 2)'        # run a one-liner
echo 'print("hi")' | lua-rs -   # read from stdin
lua-rs -v                       # version
```

`lua-rs` follows the standard `lua` CLI. Build from source with
`cargo build --release --bin lua-rs`.

## Rust embedding API

`lua-rs-runtime` is a Rust-native embedding API shaped after `mlua`, for
running Lua scripts inside a Rust program. Because the whole runtime is Rust,
it embeds where `mlua` can't: `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, no C toolchain, no
`liblua` to link. That is the reason to reach for it over a C binding (you do
not get LuaJIT, and the project is younger).

It supports owned GC-rooted handles (`Value`, `Table`, `Function`,
`LuaString`, `AnyUserData`), closure callbacks (`create_function` /
`create_function_mut`), re-entrant callbacks, conversion traits (`IntoLua`,
`FromLua`, `IntoLuaMulti`, `FromLuaMulti`), and `UserData` for binding Rust
types with methods, fields, and metamethods (a `#[derive(LuaUserData)]` macro
generates the boilerplate).

```rust
use lua_rs_runtime::{Lua, Result};

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let lua = Lua::new();
    let f = lua.create_function(|_, name: String| Ok(format!("hello, {name}")))?;
    lua.globals().set("greet", f)?;

    let out: String = lua.load(r#"return greet("lua-rs")"#).eval()?;
    assert_eq!(out, "hello, lua-rs");
    Ok(())
}
```

### Scope: lending non-`'static` borrows

`Lua::scope` lends Lua a value that lives on the Rust stack for one call (the
classic case is a game engine's `&mut World`). The borrow is invalidated when
the scope returns, so a script that stashes a handle and uses it later gets a
clean Lua error instead of touching freed memory.

```rust
lua.scope(|s| {
    let world = s.create_userdata_ref_mut(&lua, &mut my_world)?;
    lua.globals().set("world", &world)?;
    lua.load("world:spawn('player')").exec()
})?;
```

`Scope::create_function` does the same for closures that capture non-`'static`
borrows, and `AnyUserData::delegate` returns a sub-userdata that re-borrows a
field of its parent per call, so an `App -> World -> Component` chain stays a
chain of short borrows. Runnable example:
[`cargo run -p lua-rs-runtime --example scope_world`](crates/lua-rs-runtime/examples/scope_world.rs).

design rationale in [docs/design/EMBEDDING_API.md](docs/design/EMBEDDING_API.md).

## Conformance

The upstream Lua 5.4.7 test suite runs unmodified against `lua-rs`, with output
diffed against reference C:

```bash
TEST_TIMEOUT_S=90 ./harness/run_official_all.sh   # 44/44 PASS
```

This is evidence of Lua source/runtime compatibility. It does not imply C API or
ABI compatibility, and stock Lua C modules that expect `liblua` won't load.

## Safety

Most crates build under `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. The trusted unsafe surface is
budgeted in `lua-gc` for the collector, `lua-cli` for optional dynamic-library
loading, and the dedicated `lua-wasm` / `lua-wasm-smoke` crates for the
WebAssembly linear-memory pointer ABI. The core VM, stdlib, parser, runtime
helper, and package wrapper stay outside that unsafe surface. It is not 100%
safe Rust yet. See [docs/LUA_SYSTEM_DEEP_DIVE.md](docs/LUA_SYSTEM_DEEP_DIVE.md).

## Performance

`lua-rs` is benchmarked against reference Lua 5.4.7 on every commit. At the
latest commit the geomean wall time is ~1.27× C and peak memory ~1.96× C, with
some workloads faster than C. It is competitive with C, not faster, and is not
LuaJIT. [Live dashboard.](https://ianm199.github.io/lua-rs/harness/bench/history/)

## WebAssembly

`lua-rs` also ships as [`lua-rs-wasm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lua-rs-wasm),
a browser and Node package for running Lua inside WebAssembly without bundling
the C Lua interpreter.

```bash
npm install lua-rs-wasm
```

Try it in the browser:
[ianm199.github.io/lua-rs/examples/wasm-browser/](https://ianm199.github.io/lua-rs/examples/wasm-browser/).

Use it from a browser or bundler:

```js
import { loadLuaRs, luaRsWasmUrl } from "lua-rs-wasm";

const { lua } = await loadLuaRs(luaRsWasmUrl, {
  onStdout: (chunk) => console.log(chunk),
});

lua.exec(`
local function fib(n)
  if n < 2 then return n end
  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
end

print("fib(20) = " .. fib(20))
`);
```

Use it from Node:

```js
import { loadLuaRsNode } from "lua-rs-wasm/node";

const { lua } = await loadLuaRsNode({
  onStdout: (chunk) => process.stdout.write(chunk),
});

lua.exec('print("hello from lua-rs wasm")');
```

The WebAssembly package targets `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. That means there is no
ambient operating system: stdout, stdin, environment variables, time, and file
access come from JS host hooks. The package provides a small in-memory host for
common browser/Node use cases, including `print`, `io.open`, `require` from
provided files, and stateful `lua.exec(...)` calls. The native `lua-rs` CLI is
still the right choice for terminal use, and WASI support is separate future
work.

[harness/wasm/README.md](harness/wasm/README.md). For npm release steps, see
[docs/NPM_WASM_PUBLISHING.md](docs/NPM_WASM_PUBLISHING.md).

## LuaRocks

`lua-rs` runs the stock LuaRocks 3.11.1 client and installs pure-Lua rocks
(verified with `inspect`, `dkjson`, `argparse`, `middleclass`, `say`, and
`luassert`). Native C rocks are not supported yet.

LuaRocks looks for a `lua` interpreter on `PATH`, so point it at `lua-rs`:

```bash
curl -sSL https://luarocks.org/releases/luarocks-3.11.1.tar.gz | tar xz -C /tmp
mkdir -p /tmp/lua-bin
ln -sf "$(command -v lua-rs)" /tmp/lua-bin/lua
ln -sf "$(command -v lua-rs)" /tmp/lua-bin/lua5.4

HOME=/tmp/lua-rs-home PATH="/tmp/lua-bin:$PATH" \
LUA_PATH="/tmp/luarocks-3.11.1/src/?.lua;/tmp/luarocks-3.11.1/src/?/init.lua" \
  lua-rs /tmp/luarocks-3.11.1/src/bin/luarocks --tree /tmp/rocks install inspect

LUA_PATH="/tmp/rocks/share/lua/5.4/?.lua;;" lua-rs -e 'print(require("inspect")({1, 2, 3}))'
```

## Future goals

- Get to full safety: drive the remaining `unsafe` (in the garbage collector and
  the dynamic-library loader) to zero, so the whole runtime is safe Rust.
- Reach performance parity with reference Lua 5.4.
- Broaden the Rust embedding API: richer mlua parity, by-value non-`'static`
  userdata, more Miri/fuzz coverage, sandbox presets, and future async/fuel
  hooks. See [docs/FUTURE_GOALS.md](docs/FUTURE_GOALS.md) and
  [docs/EMBEDDING_API_IMPLEMENTATION.md](docs/EMBEDDING_API_IMPLEMENTATION.md).
