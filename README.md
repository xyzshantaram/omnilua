# lua-rs

A Lua 5.4.7 interpreter written in Rust. It runs Lua programs as a standalone
binary with no C dependency, and passes the full upstream PUC-Rio test suite
(44/44).

```bash
cargo install lua-cli      # the crate is `lua-cli`; the binary it installs is `lua-rs`
lua-rs -e 'print("hello")'
```

## Highlights

- Passes the full upstream Lua 5.4.7 test suite (44/44).
- A standalone binary: no `liblua`, no C interpreter, no C toolchain to build it.
- Mostly safe Rust, with unsafe isolated to audited GC, dynamic-loading, and
  WASM pointer-ABI boundaries.
- Competitive with reference C (~1.3× geomean wall time), benchmarked per commit.

## Usage

```bash
lua-rs                          # REPL
lua-rs script.lua               # run a file
lua-rs -e 'print(1 + 2)'        # run a one-liner
echo 'print("hi")' | lua-rs -   # read from stdin
lua-rs -v                       # version
```

`lua-rs` follows the standard `lua` CLI. Build from source with
`cargo build --release --bin lua-rs`.

## Conformance

The upstream Lua 5.4.7 test suite runs unmodified against `lua-rs`, with output
diffed against reference C:

```bash
TEST_TIMEOUT_S=90 ./harness/run_official_all.sh   # 44/44 PASS
```

This is evidence of Lua source/runtime compatibility. It does not imply C API or
ABI compatibility, and stock Lua C modules that expect `liblua` won't load.

## Safety

Most crates build under `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. The trusted unsafe surface is
budgeted in `lua-gc` for the collector, `lua-cli` for optional dynamic-library
loading, and the dedicated `lua-wasm` / `lua-wasm-smoke` crates for the
WebAssembly linear-memory pointer ABI. The core VM, stdlib, parser, runtime
helper, and package wrapper stay outside that unsafe surface. It is not 100%
safe Rust yet. See [docs/LUA_SYSTEM_DEEP_DIVE.md](docs/LUA_SYSTEM_DEEP_DIVE.md).

## Performance

`lua-rs` is benchmarked against reference Lua 5.4.7 on every commit. At the
latest commit the geomean wall time is ~1.27× C and peak memory ~1.96× C, with
some workloads faster than C. It is competitive with C, not faster, and is not
LuaJIT. [Live dashboard.](https://ianm199.github.io/lua-rs/harness/bench/history/)

## WebAssembly

The interpreter core and stdlib crates build for bare
`wasm32-unknown-unknown`, and the repo includes runtime smoke tests that
instantiate the generated `.wasm` with Node's `WebAssembly` API and a headless
browser:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS='-Awarnings' cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -p lua-wasm --release
node harness/wasm/runtime-smoke.mjs
node harness/wasm/browser-smoke.mjs   # requires Chrome/Chromium, or set LUA_RS_BROWSER
```

This currently verifies JS-provided Lua source execution, pure Lua execution,
JS-provided host imports for stdout/stdin/env/time/read-only Lua module loading,
JS-backed `io.open` read/write/seek/setvbuf handles, JS-backed errno
propagation for file read failures, stateful `lua.exec(...)` calls plus reset,
Lua-level failures for unsupported temp-file capabilities, and last-error
reporting back to JS. The native `lua-rs` CLI is not a bare-WASM binary; it
depends on terminal/filesystem/process functionality. The current Rust
embedding helper is `lua-rs-runtime::{LuaRuntime, HostHooks}`, and
`packages/lua-rs-wasm` exposes a browser-compatible
`loadLuaRs(...).lua.exec(...)` wrapper over the WASM ABI plus a
`lua-rs-wasm/node` helper for Node consumers. Its `prepack` script builds and
includes `dist/lua_wasm.wasm` for npm packaging. The package can be
published with the manual `Publish lua-rs-wasm` GitHub Actions workflow once the
repository has an `NPM_TOKEN` secret. Adding WASI support is separate future work. See
[harness/wasm/README.md](harness/wasm/README.md) for the runnable host-callback
smoke, and [docs/NPM_WASM_PUBLISHING.md](docs/NPM_WASM_PUBLISHING.md) for the
publish runbook.

## LuaRocks

`lua-rs` runs the stock LuaRocks 3.11.1 client and installs pure-Lua rocks
(verified with `inspect`, `dkjson`, `argparse`, `middleclass`, `say`, and
`luassert`). Native C rocks are not supported yet.

LuaRocks looks for a `lua` interpreter on `PATH`, so point it at `lua-rs`:

```bash
curl -sSL https://luarocks.org/releases/luarocks-3.11.1.tar.gz | tar xz -C /tmp
mkdir -p /tmp/lua-bin
ln -sf "$(command -v lua-rs)" /tmp/lua-bin/lua
ln -sf "$(command -v lua-rs)" /tmp/lua-bin/lua5.4

HOME=/tmp/lua-rs-home PATH="/tmp/lua-bin:$PATH" \
LUA_PATH="/tmp/luarocks-3.11.1/src/?.lua;/tmp/luarocks-3.11.1/src/?/init.lua" \
  lua-rs /tmp/luarocks-3.11.1/src/bin/luarocks --tree /tmp/rocks install inspect

LUA_PATH="/tmp/rocks/share/lua/5.4/?.lua;;" lua-rs -e 'print(require("inspect")({1, 2, 3}))'
```

## Future goals

- Get to full safety: drive the remaining `unsafe` (in the garbage collector and
  the dynamic-library loader) to zero, so the whole runtime is safe Rust.
- Reach performance parity with reference Lua 5.4.
- A polished Rust embedding API: `lua-rs-runtime` now has the first thin helper
  for running chunks with host hooks; closure-based browser/app embedding is the
  next layer. See [docs/FUTURE_GOALS.md](docs/FUTURE_GOALS.md).
