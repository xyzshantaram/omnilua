//! Regression test for the T2-B2 install-once chaining panic hook.
//!
//! `aux_resume` (lua-stdlib `coro_lib.rs`) installs a single process-global
//! chaining panic hook on first resume and scopes its `LuaThreadClose`
//! suppression with a thread-local counter, replacing the old per-resume
//! `take_hook` / `set_hook` / restore dance. The behavioral contract that must
//! survive that change: a **non-`LuaThreadClose`** panic raised inside a
//! resumed coroutine still reaches the hook that was current before lua-rs
//! installed its chaining hook — it is delegated to, not swallowed.
//!
//! This file is its own integration-test binary, so it runs in a dedicated
//! process with a fresh `OnceLock` and a clean panic-hook stack. That isolates
//! it from the rest of `cargo test`'s multi-threaded process: no other test's
//! panic, and no other test's resume, can race the once-only install here.
//!
//! The test installs a flag-setting hook **before** the first resume so the
//! chaining hook captures it as its delegate, drives one resume to perform the
//! install, then resumes a coroutine that calls a panicking Rust host
//! function. It asserts the flag was set (the previous hook ran) and that the
//! panic still propagated to the embedder as a Lua error (the callback
//! boundary's own `catch_unwind` converts it, exactly as before this change).
