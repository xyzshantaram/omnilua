//! Acceptance-test fixture: a Rust-native Lua module exposed as a `cdylib`
//! so the `dynlib_*_hook` path through `package.loadlib` can be exercised
//! end-to-end.
//!
//! The exported symbol matches this build's Rust-native module ABI:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! fn(&mut LuaState) -> Result<usize, LuaError>
//! ```
//!
//! That signature is what `DynamicSymbol::RustNative` carries, and what the
//! `lua-cli` `dynlib_symbol` hook hands back when the symbol name does not
//! start with `luaopen_`. The acceptance test calls
//! `package.loadlib("./libtest.so", "rust_open")` so the symbol resolves
//! through the Rust-native path; the function pushes the integer `42` and
//! returns 1 to signal "one return value on the stack".
