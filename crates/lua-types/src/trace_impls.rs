//! Phase-D `Trace` implementations for types defined in this crate.
//!
//! Each impl enumerates the type's GC-bearing fields and either calls
//! `field.trace(m)` (delegating to the field's own `Trace` impl) or
//! `m.mark(field)` (when the field is a `Gc<T>` from `lua-gc`). During the
//! Phase A/B/C/D-0 window `GcRef<T>` is still an `Rc<T>` newtype rather
//! than the real `Gc<T>`, so the mark-queue path is not yet reachable —
//! method resolution dispatches through `Deref` to each underlying type's
//! own `trace` method.

/// and ultimately to Black during gray-queue drainage. The previous
/// `try_visit` short-circuit was a Phase A-D-0 workaround for the
/// `Rc`-backed handle (no header, no color), and produced a silent bug
/// post-D-1e: every GC-tracked allocation stayed White and was freed in
/// the sweep on the first `collectgarbage()`. Cycles are now handled
/// natively by the heap's gray-queue (Color::Gray check in `mark` makes
/// re-visits idempotent).
